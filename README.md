# TIL-of-BootCamp-Flask
스파르타코딩클럽 내일배움캠프 1기 동기들은 어떻게 TIL을 쓰고 있을까? (블로그 스크래핑 사이트) - Original Flask Version
Sparta TIL is a website that collects and displays the Today-I-Learned posts from the students who completed the backend bootcamp course at Sparta Coding Club, a programming academy in South Korea. The website was created with two different frameworks: Python's Flask and Java's Spring. The purpose of this project was to practice and compare the features and functionalities of both frameworks, as well as to create a platform for sharing and learning from each other's experiences.
